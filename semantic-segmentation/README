In this project, we'll label the pixels of a road in images using a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN).

Setup
Clone the repo from https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation

Download the Kitti Road dataset from http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip. 
Extract the dataset in the data folder. This will create the folder data_road with all the training and test images.
